## DDS Version Number Scheme

DDS version has a form of ```MAJOR.MINOR(.PATCH)```, where:

```MAJOR``` - the major number is increased when there are significant jumps in functionality.  
```MINOR``` - the minor number is incremented when only minor features or significant fixes have been added.  
```PATCH``` - represents a number of commits (patches) to a current major.minor pair.

**Note**  
The DDS's version scheme reflects the fact that DDS is both a production system and a research project. DDS uses odd minor version numbers to denote development releases and even minor version numbers to denote stable releases.
