## v2.6 (NOT YET RELEASED)

### dds-tools-api
Fixed: newly created DDS session fails to send custom commands.    
Added: Agent count options moved from SAgentInfoRequest to a new SAgentCountRequest.    
Added: Sync counterparts for each request in Tools API.    

### dds-topology

Fixed: build system writes temporary files only in build directory. (GH-182)   
Fixed: Workaround wait_for bug in boost::process.    
Added: support relative task executables. (GH-216)

Added: The command reports now the time it took to submit the job.    

### dds-agent
Modified: The watchdog now terminates/kills not only user tasks (parent processes), but also their children if they spawn any. (GH-212)    

### dds-topology
Fixed: dds-topology --activate hangs if there are no active agents. (GH-218)

### dds\_intercom\_lib
Removed: notification on key delete CKeyValue::subscribeOnDelete.
