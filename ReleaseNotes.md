# Release Notes

## [3.16.0] - 2025-10-09

### üéâ New Features

#### Tools API Environment Variable Support

- **Automatic Lightweight Mode**: Tools API now automatically detects and respects the `DDS_LIGHTWEIGHT_PACKAGE` environment variable
- **No More `make wn_bin`**: When using lightweight mode, you no longer need to build the worker binary package with `make wn_bin` - a huge time saver!
- **Simplified API Usage**: Users no longer need to manually set the `enable_lightweight` flag when the environment variable is set
- **Consistent Behavior**: Tools API now behaves consistently with command-line tools (`dds-session` and `dds-submit`)
- **Smaller Packages**: Worker packages reduced from ~15MB to ~50KB in lightweight mode

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Critical SLURM Plugin Fix for Lightweight Mode

- **Job Submission Failure**: Fixed critical bug in SLURM plugin that caused job submissions to fail with "No partition specified or system default partition" error when using lightweight mode
- **Root Cause**: The job script template incorrectly placed executable validation code before #SBATCH directives, violating SLURM's parsing requirements. SLURM stops processing #SBATCH options when it encounters the first executable line, causing all subsequent directives (including `--partition`) to be ignored
- **Template Bug**: The placeholder `#DDS_LIGHTWEIGHT_VALIDATION` appeared in both a comment line and the code section. The `boost::replace_all()` function replaced both occurrences, breaking the comment syntax and injecting executable code before #SBATCH directives
- **Resolution**: 
  - Removed lightweight validation code from the job script template entirely
  - Eliminated blank lines between #SBATCH directive placeholders
  - Validation logic moved to worker nodes where it's actually needed (DDSWorker.sh)
- **Impact**: SLURM now correctly parses all #SBATCH directives including partition specifications, resource requirements, and job options

#### Critical Worker Package Deployment Fix

- **DDSWorker.sh Logic Error**: Fixed inverted logic bug that caused worker package deployment to fail when pre-compiled binaries were present
- **Impact**: This bug prevented users from deploying full worker packages (with binaries) even though the binaries were correctly packaged
- **Resolution**: The script now correctly:
  - Extracts and uses binaries when they exist (full package mode)
  - Validates lightweight mode requirements when binaries are absent (lightweight package mode)

### üöÄ For Users

#### If You Use SLURM with Lightweight Mode

If you experienced SLURM job submission failures with errors like:

```text
Batch job submission failed: No partition specified or system default partition
```

This was caused by a critical bug in the SLURM plugin template that placed executable code before #SBATCH directives. SLURM stopped parsing directives when it encountered this code, ignoring your partition specifications and other settings.

**The fix requires rebuilding DDS:**

```bash
cd /path/to/DDS/build
make
make install
```

After rebuilding, your SLURM submissions with lightweight mode will work correctly, and all #SBATCH directives (including partition, CPU requirements, etc.) will be properly recognized.

#### If You Use Tools API

Before this fix, you had to explicitly set the lightweight flag:

```cpp
submitInfo.setFlag(SSubmitRequestData::ESubmitRequestFlags::enable_lightweight, true);
```

Now, simply set the environment variable before running your application:

```bash
export DDS_LIGHTWEIGHT_PACKAGE=1
./my_dds_app
```

The Tools API will automatically:

- Start sessions with `--lightweight` flag
- Configure submit requests for lightweight mode

#### If You Experienced Worker Package Failures

If you previously encountered errors like:

```text
Error: Can't find WN pre-compiled bin.: /path/to/dds-wrk-bin-3.14-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

This was caused by the DDSWorker.sh bug and is now fixed. Your worker packages will deploy correctly regardless of whether they contain pre-compiled binaries or are in lightweight mode.
