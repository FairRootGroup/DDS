## v3.4 (2020-07-01)

### DDS common
Modified: General improvements and bug fixes.

### dds-tools-api
Added: active topology filepath in commander info request.

## v3.2 (2020-05-12)

### DDS common
Added: Users now can specify custom environment scripts for each task. (GH-24)    
Modified: Improved cleaning of child processes of user tasks.     
Fixed: If process is killed or crased it can leave opened and locked interprocess mutex. It leads to hanging boost::interprocess::message_queue::timed_send function. The function tries to write to the queue which is locked by the mutex from the killed process. BOOST implements a workaround flag - BOOST_INTERPROCESS_ENABLE_TIMEOUT_WHEN_LOCKING. It forces the boost::interprocess to use timed mutexes instead of a simple ones.    

### dds-agent
Modified: Intercom channel got a dedicated service. Now DDS main transport and Intercom work on different threads. (GH-279)    
Modified: Significantly improved performance of stopping of user tasks.

Added: new optional XML attribute which allows to set number of tasks in the collection.    
Modified: major update of the topology API. Significantly improved topology construction API.    
Modified: new way of task and collection ID calculation. String which is used for CRC64 based ID calculation now includes path ID and an object hash string. This allows to detect also the content changes of the topology objects. Topology update uses the new feature in order to better detect difference between two topologies.    

### dds-submit
Fixed: a bug, which caused the command to block if an unknown plug-in is requested.     
Fixed: CLI returns 1 if submission failed. (GH-227)    

### localhost plug-in
Modified: Requares now the --slots argument.    

### ssh plug-includes
Modified: Replace custom thread pool with boost asio's thread__pool.    
Modified: Improve performence and stability.

Fixed: Support list of values in DDS_LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (GH-262)

Added: DDS SM now supports multiple input queues.    
Added: Add timestamp and log delivery time for Custom Commands.

### dds-tools-api
Fixed: newly created DDS session fails to send custom commands.    
Added: Agent count options moved from SAgentInfoRequest to a new SAgentCountRequest.    
Added: Sync counterparts for each request in Tools API.    
Added: Start/Stop DDS session multiple times within the same process.    

### dds-topology
Added: parsing and reporting of the topology name: "dds-info --active-topology", "dds-topology --topology-name <topo.xml>", CTopology::getName().    
Fixed: activate hangs on xml validation error. (GH-220).    
Added: get filter iterator matching the task/collection runtime path in the topology.    
Added: calculation of the topology hash as CRC32.    
Fixed: check that agent's topology hash is the same as commander's one before task assignment. Fixes GH-265.    

### dds-info
Fixed: SIGSEGV in dds-info. (GH-261)   
Added: --wait option to wait for the required number of agents online. Must be used together with  --active-count, --idle-count, --executing-count.    
Added: --active-count, --idle-count, --executing-count option to get the number of active, idle or executing agents respectively. These option can be used together with --wait in order to wait for the required number of agents.    
Removed: --wait-for-idle-agents, --wait-for-executing-agents are obsolete. Replaced with -idle-count, --executing-count options used toghether with --wait option.

Added: The command reports now the time it took to submit the job.    

### dds-agent
Modified: The watchdog now terminates/kills not only user tasks (parent processes), but also their children if they spawn any. (GH-212)    

### dds-topology
Fixed: dds-topology --activate hangs if there are no active agents. (GH-218)

### dds-ssh
Added: the ssh plug-in has been extended to support multiple agents per host. (GH-25)   
Added: each DDS scout uses separate stderr/-out file (scout.log), when more than one worker requested per machine.

Fixed: Revised write message algorithms. It is also faster now.    
Fixed: a bug in the dds-agent, which could cause a SEGFAULT when trying to access a deleted channel object on disconnect.
